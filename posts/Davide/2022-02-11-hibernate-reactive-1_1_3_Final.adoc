https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/1.1/#getting_started[Hibernate Reactive 1.1.3.Final] is now available!

The main feature of this release is that it's now possible to connect to an instance
of Oracle database.

{milestone}[The complete list of changes] is available on GitHub.

Thank you!

== Oracle

Testing Hibernate Reactive with Oracle requires
the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-oracle-client/java/[Oracle Vert.x SQL client] on the classpath:

[source]
----
io.vertx:vertx-oracle-client:4.2.4
----

We are aware of https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-reactive/issues/1168[a couple of limitations]:

* it's not possible to query fields mapped as `raw`
* insert-select queries cause an exception


== How can I get it?

All details are available on the 
link:https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/1.1/#get-it[Hibernate Reactive website releases page].

If you are new to Hibernate Reactive, {getting-started}[the official documentation] is a good place to start.
