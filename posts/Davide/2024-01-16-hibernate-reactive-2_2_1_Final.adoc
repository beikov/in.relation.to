https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/2.2/#getting_started[Hibernate Reactive 2.2.1.Final] is now available!

This release is compatible with Hibernate ORM 6.4.1.Final and Vert.x SQL driver 4.5.1.

This version also contains:

* Support for the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/main/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/query/Order.java[Order] class introduced in Hibernate ORM 6.3 
* Support for `Stateless#upsert` on all databases
* Fix out of the box support for arrays of basic types

{release}[The full list of changes] is available on GitHub.

We have also released https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/2.0/#getting_started[Hibernate Reactive 2.0.8.Final].
This version will still work with Vertx SQL client 4.5.1, but we decided to revert the upgrade because it was
preventing other application to upgrade to the latest 2.0 version.

== How can I get it?

All details are available on the 
link:https://hibernate.org/reactive/releases/2.2/#get-it[Hibernate Reactive website releases page].
