Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.1: {released-version}.

== What's new

This release introduces a few minor improvements as well as bug fixes.

=== Improvements

==== DB2 aliases

Hibernate schema validation now supports table aliases also for DB2, to enable this feature is necessary to set the `hibernate.synonyms` configuration property to `true` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15585[15585])


=== Bugfixes

==== Hibernate Gradle Plugin

We have fixed two bugs affecting the Gradle plugin:

* A bug causing failures when trying to enhance entities has been fixed (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15597[HHH-15597])
* A bug preventing to execute tasks whose names consist of three or more parts, e.g. `compileThreePartNameJava` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15558[HHH-15558])


==== Entity Graph and Inheritance

We have fixed a bug preventing to eager loading an association of a Single Table Inheritance (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15622[HHH-15622])
