Hibernate ORM 6.2.0.CR4 has just been link:{jira-released-page}[released].  It contains 61 resolutions, including 33 bug-fixes.  Many of these improvements come directly from the excellent feedback and bug reports we continue to get from the community.  Thank you again for the continued support and feedback!


== What's next?

I fully expect this to be the final CR before Final.  https://hibernate.org/reactive/[Hibernate Reactive] has started to stabilize on the road to 2.0, so
additional SPI changes are less and less likely.
