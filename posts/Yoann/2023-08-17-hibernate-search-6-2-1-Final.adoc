We just published a maintenance release for Hibernate Search:
6.2.1.Final.

This release mainly upgrades to Hibernate ORM 6.2.7.Final for `-orm6` artifacts,
upgrades to Elasticsearch client 8.9.0,
adds compatibility with Elasticsearch 8.9 and OpenSearch 2.9,
and fixes several bugs.

== What's new

* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4744[HSEARCH-4744]:
Hibernate Search is now able to read Jandex indexes of repackaged Spring applications (uberjars),
providing the application runs on Java 13+.
* link:{hsearch-jira-url-prefix}/HSEARCH-4915[HSEARCH-4915]:
Search queries with partial failures (some successful shards, some failing)
can now trigger an exception if you set the configuration property
link:{hsearch-doc-url-prefix}#backend-elasticsearch-search-ignore-partial-shard-failure[`hibernate.search.backend.query.shard_failure.ignore`]
to `false`.
+
This will be the default behavior in Hibernate Search 7.
