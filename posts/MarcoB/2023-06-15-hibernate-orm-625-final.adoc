Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: {released-version}.

== What's new

This maintenance release keeps improving stability with several bugfixes.

[[bugfixes]]

=== Bugfixes

==== Second level cache fixes

We have fixed several bugs related to Hibernate's second level cache functionalities:

* Caching was not working properly for entities with inheritance when `hibernate.cache.use_structured_entries` was enabled (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16714[HHH-16714]).

* Hibernate failed to access a lazy fetched `@ManyToOne` association which was part of a composite `@IdClass` identifier when stored in L2 cache (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16673[HHH-16673]).

* A `TransientObjectException` was encountered when loading a versioned entity from the second level cache with a `@OneToOne` lazy mapping (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16745[HHH-16745]).

==== Treated and generic association joins

We addressed a couple issues that occurred when joining on generic or treated association paths:

* When joining on a treated association we failed to retrieve the attribute from the correct treat target type (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16574[HHH-16574]).

* When joining on a `MappedSuperclass` generic association there was a problem recognizing the association attribute from the concrete (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16693[HHH-16693]).

==== Mapping the same column to different properties

* We have fixed several issues that were reported for different use cases which had problems when mapping the same underlying database column to different model properties (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-15929[HHH-15929]).

==== Batching and composite identifiers

We have fixed a couple bugs related to composite identifiers when batching was enabled:

* Fetching an element collection on an entity with a composite `@EmbeddedId` identifier failed with batch enabled (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16740[HHH-16740]).

* A `ClassCastException` was triggered when an entity with an `@ElementCollection` had an `@EmbeddedId` with just one field and batching was enabled (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16750[HHH-16750]).
