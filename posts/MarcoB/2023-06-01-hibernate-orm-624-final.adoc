Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: {released-version}.

== What's new

This release includes several bug fixes and small performance improvements.

[[type-pollution]]

=== Type pollution improvements

We keep gradually improving Hibernate's performance, with special regard to the https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8180450[type pollution issue] currently affecting the JDK (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16629[HHH-16629]).

[[plugin-static-metamodel]]

=== Hibernate Gradle plugin

==== Dropped support for JPA static metamodel generation

Support for JPA static metamodel generation in the Hibernate Gradle plugin was dropped. You can find more details https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16677[here].

[[bugfixes]]

=== Bugfixes

==== Entity associations and joins

We have fixed some issues related to the handling of entity associations and `joins`:

* We now avoid joining tables in more scenarios and should only introduce `joins` when really needed (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16691[HHH-16691]).

* An error was causing a result multiplication when both `FetchMode.JOIN` and batching were used for retrieving `@OneToMany` associated items (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16570[HHH-16570]).

* We now throw an appropriate error when an entity join that is not a `cross join` doesn't define an on clause (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16495[HHH-16495]).

* A lazy association in a `@Cacheable` entity was already retrieved as initialized (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16613[HHH-16613]).

==== Query caching

We have fixed several bugs related to query caches, specifically regarding the key used for the cache:

* The query cache key was not correctly serializable when working with an enabled `@Filter` or `@TenantId` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16385[HHH-16385]).

* `@Filter` parameters were not included in the query cache key causing some inconsistent results when using different values (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16617[HHH-16617]).

* Query parameters were not always processed in the same order when generating the query cache key, causing sporadic cache misses expecially with a high number of parameters and criteria queries (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16594[HHH-16594]).

==== Map type associations

We have a couple bugs related to `Map` type associations:

* Using the `@MapKey` annotation led to wrongly generated SQL for inserts in some cases (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16370[HHH-16370]).

* An error was encountered when using an `Embeddable` typed element collection in a map association (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16540[HHH-16540]).

==== Null Pointer Exceptions

The latest Hibernate updates introduced a couple cases triggering a `NullPointerException` that were fixed:

* An NPE was encountered when generating the mapping metamodel if inheritance was used for an `@IdClass` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16664[HHH-16664]).

* An entity with an `@Any` annotated attribute caused a null pointer when merging (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16532[HHH-16532]).
