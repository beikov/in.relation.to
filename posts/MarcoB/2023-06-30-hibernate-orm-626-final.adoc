Today, we published a new maintenance release of Hibernate ORM 6.2: {released-version}.

== What's new

This update includes several bugfixes and further stabilization as we approach the release of the next minor Hibernate version.

[[bugfixes]]

=== Bugfixes

==== Embeddable keys and property sorting

We have fixed a bug that caused the properties of composite keys to be in an unexpected order, causing possible problems with constraints (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16514[HHH-16514])

==== Bytecode enhancement

We keep improving Hibernate's bytecode enhancement support, this time we tackled several bugs:

* Reading entities that extended a `@MappedSuperclass` declared in a different package did not work correctly (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16711[HHH-16711])

* Bytecode enhancement caused a lazy `@ManyToOne` association targeting an Entity annotated with `@Proxy(lazy = false)` to be eagerly loaded (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16794[HHH-16794])

* Hibernate failed to update a one-to-one lazy association with `OptimisticLockType.DIRTY` and enabled bytecode enhancement (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16839[HHH-16839])

* Bytecode enhancement led to a broken constructor for an embedded field declared as a generic in a `@MappedSuperclass` (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16832[HHH-16832])

==== Subqueries and joins

We addressed a couple issues that affected Hibernate generated subqeries when using joins:

* When reusing a join in a subquery the table would be referenced again instead of reusing the join (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16537[HHH-16537])

* An HQL query with a subquery that used an entity path at least two levels deep produced SQL with a missing join predicate (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16721[HHH-16721])

==== Polymorphic queries

We have fixed some bugs related to polymorphic queries:

* When using a polymorphic entity-valued path as an argument for a function a _SqmRoot not yet resolved to TableGroup_ error was triggered (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16733[HHH-16733])

* An exception was thrown when processing a polymorphic entity's nested join in a subquery (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16582[HHH-16582])

NOTE: Hibernate now uses the existing `SQM` copy logic to process entity polymorphism, keeping the behavior consistent with what was already in place for criteria queries.

==== Batch loading

In previous 6.2 versions the batch loading feature was improved several times. With this release we keep stabilizing it by fixing a couple issues:

* In-clause parameter padding did not consider the Dialect's in-expression count limit which could cause errors on the DMBS side (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16589[HHH-16589])

* When batching was enabled the `LockModeType` requested through the `session.find()` method was ignored (see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16820[HHH-16820])


There are more improvements and bugfixes included in this version. You can find the full list of changes https://hibernate.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20HHH%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20{release-id}[here].
