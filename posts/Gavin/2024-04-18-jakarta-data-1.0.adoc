Jakarta Data is a new specification for persistence in Java, scheduled for release as part of the EE 11 platform.
In a link:https://in.relation.to/2024/04/01/jakarta-data-1[previous post] I introduced the basic features of a Jakarta Data repository, with a strong emphasis on how Jakarta Data provides compile-time type safety, enabling static analysis performed by an annotation processor.

This involved moving some information that used to be expressed in procedural code into:

- annotations like `@Query` and `@Find`, and
- the names and types of repository method parameters.

Today we're going to talk about some more dynamic features of Jakarta Data.
You might anticipate that these would come with a loss of type safety, but we've found a way to avoid that.
The essential ingredient is a static metamodel.

== The static metamodel

You might already be familiar with the Jakarta Persistence static metamodel.
This was an idea I came up with way back in JPA 2.0 when annotation processing was brand-new; the goal was to bring type safety to the JPA Criteria Query API.

For an entity class `Book`, the annotation processor produces a class `Book_` exposing objects representing the persistent fields of `Book`.
For example, `Book_.title` represents the field `title` of the entity `Book`.
This is in some sense just a workaround for the fact that we've been waiting more than a quarter-century for method and field literals in the Java language.

Jakarta Data introduces its own static metamodel, which is different to the Jakarta Persistence metamodel, but conceptually very similar.
Instead of `Book_`, the Jakarta Data static metamodel for `Book` is exposed by the class `_Book`.

Let's see how the static metamodel is useful, by considering a simple example.

We're about to <<Dynamic sorting,meet>> a class called `Sort`, which represents sorting based on a field of an entity.
It's perfectly possible to obtain an instance of `Sort` by passing the name of a field:

[source,java]
----
var sort = Sort.asc("title");
----

Unfortunately, since this is in regular procedural code, and not in an annotation, the field name `"title"` cannot be validated at compile time.
So this is the bad way to do it.

A much better solution is to use the static metamodel to obtain an instance of `Sort`.

[source,java]
----
var sort = _Book.title.asc();
----

The static metamodel also declares constants containing the names of persistent fields.
For example, `_Book.TITLE` evaluates to the string `"title"`.
These constants are useful because they may be used as annotation values.

== Sorting by a static order

A `@Find` or `@Query` method may specify an order for query results.
Naturally, one way to do this is using the JDQL/JPQL `order by` clause.

[source,java]
----
@Query("where title like ?1 and yearPublished = ?2 " +
       "order by title, isbn")
List<Book> booksByTitle(String title, Year yearPublished);
----

Please recall from the previous post that `HibernateProcessor` validates the JDQL query at compile time.
If `Book` doesn't have a field named `title`, you'll know about it straight away.

An alternative approach, especially useful with `@Find` methods, is the `@OrderBy` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy("title")
@OrderBy("isbn")
List<Book> booksByTitle(String title, Year yearPublished);
----

This is still completely type safe! `HibernateProcessor` checks that `Book` really has fields named `title` and `isbn` at compile time.
If you're having trouble accepting this, here's an alternative which is exactly the same amount of typesafe:

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy(_Book.TITLE)
@OrderBy(_Book.ISBN)
List<Book> booksByTitle(String title);
----

It's extremely common for sorting to involve a dynamic selection of entity fields, and when that's the case, neither of the solutions we've just seen is appropriate.
Instead, we're going to need a way to pass objects representing sorting criteria to repository methods.

[[pagination]]
== Pagination and dynamic sorting

A query method may have additional parameters which specify:

- additional sorting criteria, and/or
- a limit and offset restricting the results which are actually returned to the client.

=== Dynamic sorting

Dynamic sorting criteria are expressed using the types `Sort` and `Order`:

- an instance of `Sort` represents a single criterion for sorting query results, and
- an instance of `Order` packages multiple ``Sort``s together.

A query method may accept an instance of `Sort`.

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                 Sort<Book> sort);
----

This method might be called as follows:

[source,java]
----
var books =
        library.books(pattern, year,
                      _Book.title.ascIgnoreCase());
----

Alternatively the method may accept an instance of `Order`.

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                 Order<Book> order);
----

The method might now be called like this:

[source,java]
----
var books =
       library.books(pattern, year,
                     Order.of(_Book.title.ascIgnoreCase(),
                              _Book.isbn.asc());
----

Dynamic sorting criteria may be combined with static criteria.

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy("title")
List<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                 Sort<Book> sort);
----

We're not convinced this is very useful in practice.

=== Limits

A `Limit` is the simplest way to express a subrange of query results.
It specifies:

- `maxResults`, the maximum number of results to be returned from the database server to the client, and,
- optionally, `startAt`, an offset from the very first result.

These values map directly the familiar `setMaxResults()` and `setFirstResults()` of the Jakarta Persistence `Query` interface.

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy(_Book.TITLE)
List<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                 Limit limit);
----
[source,java]
----
var books =
        library.books(pattern, year,
                      Limit.of(MAX_RESULTS));
----

A more sophisticated approach is provided by `PageRequest`.

=== Offset-based pagination

A `PageRequest` is superficially similar to a `Limit`, except that it's specified in terms of:

- a page `size`, and
- a numbered `page`.

We can use a `PageRequest` just like a `Limit`.

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy("title")
@OrderBy("isbn")
List<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                 PageRequest pageRequest);
----
[source,java]
----
var books =
        library.books(pattern, year,
                      PageRequest.ofSize(PAGE_SIZE));
----

Query results should be totally ordered when a repository method is used for pagination.
The easiest way to be sure that you have a well-defined total order is to specify the identifier of the entity as the last element of the order.
For this reason, we specified `@OrderBy("isbn")` in the previous example.

A repository method which accepts a `PageRequest` may return a `Page` instead of a `List`, making it easier to implement pagination.

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy("title")
@OrderBy("isbn")
Page<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                 PageRequest pageRequest);
----
[source,java]
----
var page =
        library.books(pattern, year,
                      PageRequest.ofSize(PAGE_SIZE));
var books = page.content();
long totalPages = page.totalPages();
// ...
while (page.hasNext()) {
    page = library.books(pattern, year,
                         page.nextPageRequest().withoutTotal());
    books = page.content();
    // ...
}
----

Pagination may be combined with dynamic sorting.

[source,java]
----
@Find
Page<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                 PageRequest pageRequest, Order<Book> order);
----


A repository method with return type `Page` uses SQL `offset` and `limit` (or similar, depending on the database) to implement pagination.
This is called _offset-based pagination_.
A problem with offset-based pagination is that it's quite vulnerable to missed or duplicate results when the database is modified between page requests.
Therefore, Jakarta Data offers an alternative solution, which I prefer to call _key-based pagination_.

[NOTE]
====
The specification disagrees with me and calls it _cursor-based pagination_, but please don't confuse this as having something to do with database-level cursors.
It's even sometimes called "keyset" pagination but this term makes little sense, since there's only one key involved.
Similarly, offset-based pagination is sometimes called "rowset" pagination.
This is even worse: a set of rows is by definition a relation, i.e. a table.
====

=== Key-based pagination

In key-based pagination, the query results must be totally ordered by a unique key of the result set.
The SQL offset is replaced with a restriction on the unique key, appended to the `where` clause of the query:

- a request for the _next_ page of query results uses the key value of the _last_ result on the current page to restrict the results, or
- a request for the _previous_ page of query results uses the key value of the _first_ result on the current page to restrict the results.

For key-based pagination, it's _essential_ that the query has a total order.

From our point of view as users of Jakarta Data, key-based pagination works almost exactly like offset-based pagination.
The difference is that we must declare our repository method to return `CursoredPage`.

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy("title")
@OrderBy("isbn")
CursoredPage<Book> books(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished,
                         PageRequest pageRequest);
----

On the other hand, with key-based pagination, Hibernate must do some work under the covers rewriting our query.

== Current status

We're mere days from wrapping up work on the final proposal for Jakarta Data 1.0, though the specification must still undergo a review ballot.

Hibernate Data Repositories already implements the specification completely, but the current plan is to release it as part of Hibernate 6.6.
It's already available in some sort of "preview" form in Hibernate 6.5 CR1, but we needed to make some important enhancements to `StatelessSession`, and we didn't think it entirely proper to sneak such things into a CR2 release.
