Hibernate ORM `5.6.0.Beta2` was released today 

== Changelog

While the `5.6` series was planned to be light on user facing features, as https://in.relation.to/2021/08/27/hibernate-orm-560-beta1-release/[I previously explained], there are actually some nice small improvements to call out:

 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-4369[A new annotation `@Comment`] can be used to add comment definitions in the schema for a column.
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-13999[An improved Dialect for SQL Server 2016 (and newer)]
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14813[The DB2 dialect now respects binding limits]
 * Various improvements in Hibernate Spatial: new geolatte-geom v. 1.8.2, fixed dirty checking of `GeometryCollection`
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14796[It's now possible to replace a JPQL based query with a custom native SQL query]

And some important bugfixes:
 
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14828[Bytecode enhancement now deals better with `final` attributes]
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14826[Fields of a one-to-one relation loaded from 2lc are correctly hydrated]
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14811[Wrong exception type being thrown when accessing a lazy property on a deleted entity]
 * https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14827[`@AttributeOverride` wasn't applied when mapped via orm.xml]

== Bye bye Javassist

As a reminder from the https://in.relation.to/2021/08/27/hibernate-orm-560-beta1-release/[previous post]: Javassist support has been removed.

Use Byte Buddy instead.
